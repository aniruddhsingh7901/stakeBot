# Event-Driven Staking Bot Configuration (Production-Optimized)
# Edit values as needed. This file is read at startup by stake_bot.py

# Network to connect to: "finney" (mainnet) or "test"
network: finney

# Bittensor wallet identifiers
wallet_name: default
hotkey_name: default

# Stake amount in TAO (floating point). Example: 0.05
stake_amount: 0.05

# Target subnet ID to monitor and stake on. Default: 63 (SN63)
subnet_id: 63

# =========================
# Performance & Behavior
# =========================
# fast_mode true enables explicit nonce + optional tip, direct extrinsic submit for minimal latency
fast_mode: true

# Optional tip in TAO to improve transaction priority (0 for none). Example: 0.001
tip_tao: 0.0

# Submit without waiting for inclusion/finalization for max speed
wait_for_inclusion: false
wait_for_finalization: false

# =========================
# Submission and retry behavior
# =========================
max_retries: 5
retry_backoff_seconds: 0.5     # initial backoff for retries
max_backoff_seconds: 4.0       # cap for backoff

# =========================
# Websocket reconnect/backoff on disconnects or RPC issues
# =========================
ws_reconnect_backoff_seconds: 1.0
ws_reconnect_max_backoff_seconds: 8.0

# Logging configuration
# =========================

# State persistence (to survive restarts cleanly)
# =========================
persist_state: true
state_file: stake_state.json

# =========================
# Trigger safety
# =========================
# If false: do not trigger a new stake while an unstake is pending (safer nonces)
# If true: allow overlapping triggers (more aggressive; ensure you can handle nonce priority)
